## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenges was a nice way to brush up my basics of HTML and CSS, especially Flexbox.

```css
Centers the panel
.cont{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    min-height: 100vh;
}

```

```css
Centers the item within the panel
.card{
    background-color: white;
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 365px;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    border-radius: 20px;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to outline areas such as layouts and Flexbox for future projects. Hopefully I dont spent too much time on it and gradually refine it.
